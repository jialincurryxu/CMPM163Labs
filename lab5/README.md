Part 2b modify:
The way I modify the particle system is to combine the previous two parts and first populate the whole screen with moving particles, and when the particles hit the boundary I set, their position will reset to the mouse and there will be a little particle fountain where the mouse is pointing. I also replaced the texture for the particles.
