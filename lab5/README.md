Part 2b modify:
The way I modify the particle system is to combine the previous two parts and first populate the whole screen with moving particles, and when the particles hit the boundary I set, their position will reset to the mouse and there will be a little particle fountain where the mouse is pointing. I also replaced the texture for the particles.

Unity project:
I modified the track with a more bunpy one, switch the texture for the first tree on the right to a rock texture and added some buildings into the scene. Also I add in some speed boost.
