In the scene, I made the terrain and the water based on the turtoial, and the shader for the green part of the tree is a modified ground shader. I import the objects from the URP example and assect store to make a beach workshop where 2 people trying to make a boat and escape. 

-Which part did they do? \
My partener did part 2. \
-Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most challenging? \
The hardest part for my partener is the last part, since there're more than one object and their positions play an important role. \
-Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most interesting? \
My partener like part 2b the most, since the animation looks cool with the lighting. \
