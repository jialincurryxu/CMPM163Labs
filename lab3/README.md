On the top roll are the cubes made with THREE.js library materials, from left to right are: MeshPhysicalMaterial(with modify of metalness, roughness, clearcoat, clearcoatRoughness and reflectivity), MeshPhongMaterial(the one in doc), MeshToonMaterial(with modify of color and shininess)

On the bottom roll are the cubes I made with custom shaders. The left one is an interpolation between red, green and blue. I was trying to make the rainbow effect but no success there. The one on the right is the one I made following the doc.
